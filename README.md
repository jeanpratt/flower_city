# Flower City
As an Independent Study, I created a walking tour app for Rochester, NY. The app guides its users to historic locations that have defined this city's horticultural industry.

I was the sole developer for this project, but the content itself was written by the very talented Maeve McMahon. I highly recommend viewing her work, some of which can be seen [on her website](http://www.mevmcmahon.com/).
